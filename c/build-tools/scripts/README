Misc. support tools for RTEMS workspaces.
More will be added later as they are converted from Teamware
to CVS.

install-if-change
    Smart install script that also can append suffixes as it
    installs (suffixes used for debug and profile variants).
    Requires bash or ksh.

rcs-clean
    deletes all files from the current directory that can be
    re-created from RCS.  Careful to not delete locked files.
    May be used by 'gmake clobber'

lock-directory
unlock-directory
    traverse a directory structure making it unwritable.
    Useful to keep people from accidentally overwriting
    "released" trees if they get confused about which
    module they have loaded.

rtems-glom
    glom together all the rtems libraries in order to simplify
    the link line used by applications.
    Produces rtems.rel.
    Not used by the RTEMS src tree at all.
    Strictly optional.
