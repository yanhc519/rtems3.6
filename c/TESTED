This file is current as of the 3.5.17 snapshot.

The RTEMS project uses SparcStations running the Solaris 2.3 operating
system internally for development.  This release has been tested on the
following Languages/CPUs/Targets using Solaris 2.3/SPARC as the host
environment:

NOTES:

"NOT TESTED" indicates that this was not tested in the testing cycle
immediately preceding the snapshot.

(1) Target board is not owned by RTEMS Project.  The target is known
    to compile and link with all appropriate tests successfully.
    If the target does not support multiprocessor configurations, then
    "ALL TESTS" does not include the multiprocessor tests.

(2) RTEMS Project cannot internally compile or test this target.

(3) Target is not intended to be executed.  It is only an example.

(4) The board owned by the RTEMS Project is broken.  The BSP is known
    to compile and link with all appropriate tests successfully.
