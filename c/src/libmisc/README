This directory contains for the "miscellaneous" library.  Currently
the only item in this library is a user extension set which checks
for a task "blowing" it's stack.

The following ideas have been mentioned for items which could go
in this library, but this list is not all inclusive:

   + Workspace Consistency Checker
   + Task Execution Time Monitor

The intent of this library is to provide a home for useful utility routines
which are dependent upon RTEMS.
