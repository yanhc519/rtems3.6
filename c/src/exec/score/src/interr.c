 *
 *  _Internal_error_Occurred
 *
 *  This routine will invoke the fatal error handler supplied by the user
 *  followed by the the default one provided by the executive.  The default
 *  error handler assumes no hardware is present to help inform the user
 *  of the problem.  Halt stores the error code in a known register,
 *  disables interrupts, and halts the CPU.  If the CPU does not have a
 *  halt instruction, it will loop to itself.
 *
 *  Input parameters:
 *    the_source  - what subsystem the error originated in
 *    is_internal - if the error was internally generated
 *    the_error   - fatal error status code
 *
 *  Output parameters:
 *    As much information as possible is stored in a CPU dependent fashion.
 *    See the CPU dependent code for more information.
 *
 *  NOTE: The the_error is not necessarily a directive status code.
