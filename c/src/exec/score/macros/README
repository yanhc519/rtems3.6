The files in this directory are not considered the "primary" source
of inlined routines for RTEMS.  The "inline" directory contains
the implementations of the inlined basis which are regularly
tested.  In general, an effort is made to keep the contents of
this directory up to date but testing is only performed irregularly
and even then it is usually with a single target processor and BSP.

The primary purpose of the code in this directory is to insure
that RTEMS can be compiled using a C compiler which does not support
static inline routines.

These were last successfully tested on 2/1/95 on a prerelease version
of 3.2.0.  The testing was done only on the Force CPU386 i386 target board.
No testing was done on version of the code in the final release.
