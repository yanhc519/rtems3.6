 *  linked by itself and placed in ROM.  This routine is the
 *  first address in the ROM space for RTEMS.  The user "calls"
 *  this address with the directive arguments in the normal place.
 *  This routine then jumps indirectly to the correct directive
 *  preserving the arguments.  The directive should not realize
 *  it has been "wrapped" in this way.  The table "_Entry_points"
 *  is used to look up the directive.
