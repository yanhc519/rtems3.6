 *  any or all of the events are pending.   If the event condition
 *  is not satisfied immediately, then the task may block with an
 *  optional timeout of TICKS clock ticks or return immediately.
 *  This determination is based on another field in the option_set
 *  parameter.  This directive returns the events received in the
 *  event_out parameter.
