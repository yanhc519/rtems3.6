These tests are brought to you by the letter `q'.

VMIN=0, VTIME=0
        Each letter you type should produce a line of output.
        The `count' should be quite large, since (as you correctly
        pointed out) the read is non-blocking.  The time should be
        the interval between typing characters.
        Type a `q' to finish the test.
VMIN=0, VTIME=20
        Again, each letter should produce a line of output.  The
        `count' should be much smaller -- the read is non-blocking
        but has a timeout of 2 seconds, so the count should be about
        half the `interval'.
        Type a `q' to finish the test.
VMIN=5, VTIME=0
        A line should be produced for every 5 characters typed.  The
        count should be 1.  This is a blocking read.
        Type a `q' as the first character of a group of 5 to finish
        the test.
VMIN=5, VTIME=20
        Type a character.  Two seconds later a line should be printed.
        Count should be 1.  Type a character, and another within 2  
seconds.
        Two seconds after last character (or right after the 5th  
character)
        a line should be printed.
        Type a `q' as the first character of a group to finish the test.
        
Clear???

Also, when testing the cooked mode input, try typing some tabs  
and/or control characters and make sure that you can backspace over  
them properly.
