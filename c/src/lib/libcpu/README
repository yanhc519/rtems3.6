This is the README file for libcpu.

This directory contains reusable libraries which are CPU dependent but not
target board dependent.  For example, the HPPA has an on chip interval timer
which may be used by all HPPA bsp's.

Another example might be the Intel i960CA has on-chip DMA which could be
supported in a library and placed in lib/libcpu/i960.  This level of support
will make it easier for others developing embedded applications on a given
CPU.
