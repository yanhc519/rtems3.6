Board description
-----------------
clock rate:	25 MHz
bus width:	8-bit PROM, 32-bit DRAM
ROM:		Up to 512KByte (Am29F040), 90 nsec chip select 0
RAM:		4 to 32 MByte DRAM SIMM (autodetect), 70 nsec,
		no parity, at CS7 or CS6+CS7 (for two-bank-SIMMs)


helas403 only supports single processor operations.

Porting
-------
This board support package is written for a typical PPC403GA
system. The rough features of this board are described above.

This BSP contains files for two startup methods:
- Direct start from Flash after powerup (with code run out of flash):
  This is the default configuration, it uses the files
	flashentry/flashentry.s
	startup/linkcmds

 Please note, that this configuration is good to startup the system,
but it will not gain maximum performance due to slow Flash access (8
bit wide only)

- Start after software download into DRAM:
  This configuration will use:
	dlentry/dlentry.s
	startup/linkcmds.dl

If you want to use the download configuration, it is sufficient to
rename the file "startup/linkcmds.dl" to "startup/linkcmds", it will
automatically reference the dlentry.s as entry code. (Renaming is not
quite elegant, a more sophisticated solution will follow in future,
any hints welcome ;-)

For adapting this BSP to other boards, the following files should be
modified:

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/flashentry/flashentry.s
	for the memory controller configuration and other basic stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/startup/linkcmds[.dl]
	for the memory layout required

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/startup/bspstart.c
	for adaption of BSP_Configuration. here you can select
	the clock source for the timers and the serial interface
	(system clock or external clock pin), the clock rates, initial
	baud rate and other stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/helas403/include/bsp.h
	some BSP-related constants

The actual drivers are placed in 
- c/src/lib/libcpu/powerpc/ppc403/*
	well, they should be generic, so there _should_ be no reason
	to mess around there (but who knows...)
