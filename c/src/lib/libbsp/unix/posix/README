This is a "generic" BSP for a modern UNIX system which is enough
System V and POSIX compliant to support at least the following:
 
  + semaphores
  + itimers
  + mmap
  + shared memory

At the moment, this BSP is known to work with the following UNIXes:

  + HP-UX 9.0.x
  + Solaris 2.x
  + Linux 1.1.x (single processor only -- mmap is broken)
