  /* I had trouble getting the tcp to be completely
     flexible to supply modes (i.e., automatically
     selecting single or normal battery backup modes based
     on inputs at power-up. If single supply mode is
     selected, the low battery detect is disabled and the
     low battery detect in normal mode does not seem to
     detect when no battery is present at all. If normal
     mode is selected and no battery is present, the
     crystal will stop, but only if reset after
     power-up. It would seem that after a power-up reset,
     with no battery, the chip may automaticlly switch to
     single supply mode which disables the low battery
     detection circuit.)  The following software tests
     works for all permiatations of low batt, reset,
     power-on reset, battery, no battery, battery on after
     Vcc,....  *except* for battery switched on for the
     first time before power up in which case the chip
     will still be in single suppy mode till restarted (a
     second call to tcp_init such as when the time is set
     or a reboot.)  The timer/clock itself should always
     be completely functional regardless of the supply
     mode. */
