data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or 
third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any 
other programs), even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

us to publicize our Dual-Use / Reuse capabilities in support of
the current administration's goals.  This can be accomplished by
calling the RTEMS phone numbers published in the documentation
or by electronic mail to "rtems@redstone.army.mil".  Your
